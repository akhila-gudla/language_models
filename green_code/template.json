Optimized Version:\n   - Provide a refactored, energy-efficient version of the code.\n2. Explanation:\n   - Explain each improvement and why it reduces energy usage.\n3. Performance Impact:\n   - Provide a qualitative estimate of the performance or efficiency impact.\n4. Best Practices:\n   - Recommend additional methods to further reduce the carbon footprint.\n\nIf certain requested optimizations cannot be applied due to insufficient context, respond with: \"Insufficient information available\".\nEnsure the final output is clear, accurate, and adheres to the focus areas.\n",
