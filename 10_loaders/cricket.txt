Beneath the sun, on fields of green,
A battle’s played, both fierce and clean.
The willow sings, the leather flies,
A ball arcs under open skies.

The bowler storms with fire and pace,
The batsman stands to hold his place.
A perfect strike, the crowd takes flight,
Their cheers roll on into the night.

The stumps stand tall, three silent guards,
Protecting dreams, defying odds.
Each run’s a tale, each shot a song,
The game endures, both short and long.

It’s more than sport, it binds, unites,
In village greens or stadium lights.
For every heart that dares compete,
Lives the timeless pulse of cricket’s beat.
